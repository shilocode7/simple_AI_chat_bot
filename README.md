## Introduction
This is a Python program that uses the OpenAI API to create a chatbot that can respond to user inputs. The chatbot is designed to respond in a cool 20-year-old slang.

## Prerequisites
To use this program, you need the following:

* Python 3.7 or higher
* An OpenAI API key

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:

* git clone https://github.com/<username>/openai-chatbot.git
* cd openai-chatbot

2 . Install the required packages:
* $ pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Update the OpenAI API key in the code. You can get your API key by signing up for OpenAI at https://beta.openai.com/signup/.

## Usage:
To run the chatbot program, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
* $ python chatbot.py

The program will prompt you to enter a message, and the chatbot will respond with a message that is generated by the OpenAI API.
# Explanation of the Code

The code is organized into several functions:
* get_api_response(prompt: str) -> str: This function calls the OpenAI API to generate a response for a given prompt. It takes a string prompt as input and returns a string response as output.
* update_prompt_list(message: str, prompt_list: List[str]) -> None: This function updates the prompt list with the latest user message. It takes a string message and a list prompt_list as input and returns nothing.
* create_prompt(message: str, prompt_list: List[str]) -> str: This function creates a prompt string for the OpenAI API. It takes a string message and a list prompt_list as input and returns a string prompt as output.
* get_bot_response(message: str, prompt_list: List[str]) -> str: This function generates a response from the chatbot for a given user message. It takes a string message and a list prompt_list as input and returns a string response as output.
* main(): This is the main function that runs the chatbot program. It initializes the prompt list, prompts the user for input, generates a response, and prints the response to the console.
# How to get your own OpenAI API key
To get your own OpenAI API key, follow these steps:
* Sign up for OpenAI at https://beta.openai.com/signup/.
* Once you are signed up, go to https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys to get your API key.
* Copy your API key and replace your_api_key_here with your actual key in the code.
## Conclusion
This Python program demonstrates how to create a chatbot using the OpenAI API. With some modifications, you can customize the chatbot to respond to user inputs in different ways.
